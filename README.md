# Identity Buy

Idenitity Buy is just a hobby project where users can get a list of identities they may want to "assume".

## Code Structure

Code is structured with two primary folders ie: client and server.

## Getting Started

Before you can work on this project locally you've gotta have these setup already

- [ ] Firebase Account
- [ ] Stripe Account
- [ ] Twilo's Sendgrid Email API

---

After you are done with the above

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iamziike/idenitity-buy.git

cd ./server && npm install && npm start

cd ./client && npm install && npm start
```

## Finally

If this setup may be a tiredsome, you can try it live [here](https://identity-buy-9ffa8.web.app/), client is hosted on Firebase and server on Heroku
